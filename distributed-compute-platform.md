# Distributed Compute Platform

### Need for distributed compute?

- Constraints
    - Memory
    - CPU
    - Disk

- Solution?
    - Run distributed workflows on multiple nodes.
    - Use of serialization and communication between each nodes.

- Type System and Memory Model
    - Think for common type system to support multiple languages.
    - Use of [[Columnar Representation]]
    - [[Apache Arrow]] for memory model.

- Query Planner
    - For SQL and DataFrame style API.

- Query Optimizations
  - Query push down to source
  - Multiple optimization rules applicable to certain instructions.

- Cost based Optimizations
    - Use of statistics to adjust query plans.

- Logical Vs Phyical Plan
    - Logical operations
        - Join
        - Aggregate
    - Physical implementations
        - InnerLoopJoin
        - MergeJoin
        - HashAggregate
