# Linear Algebra

## Fundamentals
<br/>

### Implication and Equivalence

- Proposition
    - A statement which is either true or false.
    - If P then Q is true but reverse is not applicable
        - This is an implication denoted by P => Q
    - If both P then Q and Q then P are true
        - This is an Equivalence denoted by P <=> Q

### Set Theory

- Sets
    - Collection of elements
    - X = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}
        - x (2) E X (Complete set)

- Subsets
    - If all elements in some set X belong to another Y
        - X is a subset of Y
        - X c Y

### Functions

- A rule that binds elements in set X to elements in set Y.
- X is the domain
- Y is the co domain or target set.

### Images

- When an element in X goes through f to be in Y, then element in Y is called x's image in Y.

### Domain and Range

- Left set is domain
- right set of elements post function are Range

### Onto and one to one

- If range = codomain, then onto function.

### Inverse Functions

- Collidinig mapping of elements in functions f and g which are inverse in nature.
- The function has an inverse <=>  f has one to one and onto

## Matrices
<br/>

- How are matrices useful?
    - Great for writing linear systems more compactly
- Special Matrices
    - Zero  
        - All elements are 0
    - Transpose 
        - Row to column
    - Symmetric
        - Symmetric around the diagonals
    - Upper and Lower
        - Zero elements in a triangle
    - Diagonal 
        - Onle elements within diagonal rest all zero 
    - Identity
        - 1 in diagonal 
    - Inverse 
        - Product of two square matrices is an inverse matrix
            - Both are inverses of each other 
        - Gaussian elimination

- Determinants
    - Inverse of a matrix exists if determinant != 0


## Vectors
<br/>

- 1xn and nx1 matrices
- R power n
    - Set of all nx1 matrices

- Linear Independance
    - Only one unique solution
- Linear Dependance
    - Muliple solutions
- Bases
    - Linear independance


## Linear Transformations
<br/>

- xi and xj
- c be any real number
- f is a function from X to Y.
- f is called a linear transformation if
    - f(xi) + f(xj) = f(xi + xj)
    - c * f(xi) = f(cxi)
