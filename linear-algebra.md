# Linear Algebra

## Fundamentals
<br/>

### Implication and Equivalence

- Proposition
    - A statement which is either true or false.
    - If P then Q is true but reverse is not applicable
        - This is an implication denoted by P => Q
    - If both P then Q and Q then P are true
        - This is an Equivalence denoted by P <=> Q

### Set Theory

- Sets
    - Collection of elements
    - X = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}
        - x (2) E X (Complete set)

- Subsets
    - If all elements in some set X belong to another Y
        - X is a subset of Y
        - X c Y

### Functions

- A rule that binds elements in set X to elements in set Y.
- X is the domain
- Y is the co domain or target set.

### Images

- When an element in X goes through f to be in Y, then element in Y is called x's image in Y.

### Domain and Range

- Left set is domain
- right set of elements post function are Range

### Onto and one to one

- If range = codomain, then onto function.

### Inverse Functions

- Collidinig mapping of elements in functions f and g which are inverse in nature.
- The function has an inverse <=>  f has one to one and onto
