# Rust

## Rust Lang Book
<br/>

### Getting Started

- ! is a rust macro
- Compile ahead language - create binary and givee it to somebody else
- Packages of code are called crates

### Guessing game

- Prelude is a list of things that rust automatically imports.
- Variables are immutable by default. Use mut for mutability.
- :: in ::new means new is an associated function (static method in other languages) of string type.
- References are immutable by default. Use &mut for mutability.
- Result types are enums.
    - Ok
    - Err
        - expect for error handling

- Crates are collections of source code files (Python packages)
    - Types
        - Binary - executable
        - Library - to be used in other programs

- Traits
- match expression is made up of arms
    - arm consists of a pattern
- shadowing
    - use of same variable names for type casting


### Common programming concepts

- Variables
    - mut vs immutable
        - For example, in cases where youâ€™re using large data structures, mutating an instance in place may be faster than copying and returning newly allocated instances. With smaller data structures, creating new instances and writing in a more functional programming style may be easier to think through, so lower performance might be a worthwhile penalty for gaining that clarity.

- Data types
    - Every value in rust is of a certain type
    - two subsets
        - stored in the stack, so dropped when variable goes out of scope
        - Scalar
            - single value
            - integers, floats, booleans, characters
        - Compound
            - tuple
                - let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
            - array

### Ownership

- Enables memory safety gurantees without garbage collector
- Managing heap data is why ownership exists
- Rules
    - Variables are owners 
    - Only one owner at a time 
    - value dropped when owner goes out of scope

- string literal vs String type
    - In case of string literal, values are hardcoded into the executable at compile, this make things faster
    - String::from requests memory from the heap
    - Memory is return when variable goes out of scope
        - drop function called by rust at closing }
        - double free error 
            - removal of two variables pointing to same memory locations.
            - solution?
                - move variable from original to the latest

- References
    - & - refer to values without taking ownership
    - borrowing
        - have functional parameters as References
    - Mutable References        
        - can only point to once piece of data
            - prevents data races at compile time
            - use scoping to overcome this
    - Slice 
  
        ``` 
        let s = String::from("hello); 
        let slice = &s[0..2];
        ```


### Structs 

- Similar to tuples but flexible, thanks to named properties.
  
``` 
struct User {
        username: String,
        email: String
      }
```

- struct update syntax - ..user1
- #[derive(Debug)] for debugging info
- methods
    - impl block
    - always has self pointing to struct
    - associated functions to generate new instance of struct


### Enums and pattern matching

```
enum IpAddrKind {
    V4,
    V6
}

```

- Option and match similar to scala
- if let for singular match patterns
