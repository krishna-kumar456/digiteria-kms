# Rust

## Rust Lang Book
<br/>

### Getting Started

- ! is a rust macro
- Compile ahead language - create binary and givee it to somebody else
- Packages of code are called crates

### Guessing game

- Prelude is a list of things that rust automatically imports.
- Variables are immutable by default. Use mut for mutability.
- :: in ::new means new is an associated function (static method in other languages) of string type.
- References are immutable by default. Use &mut for mutability.
- Result types are enums.
    - Ok
    - Err
        - expect for error handling

- Crates are collections of source code files (Python packages)
    - Types
        - Binary - executable
        - Library - to be used in other programs

- Traits
- match expression is made up of arms
    - arm consists of a pattern
- shadowing
    - use of same variable names for type casting


### Common programming concepts

- Variables
    - mut vs immutable
        - For example, in cases where youâ€™re using large data structures, mutating an instance in place may be faster than copying and returning newly allocated instances. With smaller data structures, creating new instances and writing in a more functional programming style may be easier to think through, so lower performance might be a worthwhile penalty for gaining that clarity.

- Data types
    - Every value in rust is of a certain type
    - two subsets
        - Scalar
            - single value
            - integers, floats, booleans, characters
        - Compound
            - tuple
                - let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
            - array
