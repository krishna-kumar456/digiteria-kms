# Lean Analytics

## Part 1

### We're all Liars

- Instincts are experiments, data is proof.
- If you can't measure it, you can't manage it.
- Case Study - Airbnb Photography 
    - Hunch - Better photos would increase rentals
    - Conceirge MVP 
        - Doing things by hand instead of building an MVP 
    - Build out components when things are working


### How to Keep Score

- Analytics
    - Tracking metrics which are critical to your business 
- Purpose for Startups
    - Find way to right product before money runs out
- Good metric?
    - Comparative
        - "Increased conversion from last week"
    - Understandable
    - is a Ratio
        - Accounting ratios for financial health of companies
        - Why ratios?
            - Easier to act on
            - inherently comparative 
    - Changes the way you behave
        - Account metrics (daily sales revenue)
        - Experimental metrics
            - Optimize product, pricing or market
        - Watchout for false metrics 
        - Metric come in pairs
            - Behind pairs there's a fundamental metric
            - Conversion Rate (% of people who bought) tied to Time to Purchase (time take to buy)
                - Tell's you about your cash flow
            - Viral Coeffecient (user referrals) and Viral cycle (time taken to invite others)
              -  Drive Adoption rate 
    - Choosing the right metric   
        - 5 things explained below 

- Qualitative vs Quantitative
    - Qualitative metrics  are  unstructured,  anecdotal,  revealing,  and  hard  to aggregate
    - quantitative metrics involve numbers and statistics, and provide hard numbers but less insight.
    - Both have its parts

- Vanity vs Actionable
    - Actionable metrics change your behaviour
    - Example of Vanity - Watchout!
        - Total signups
            - Can only increase,  doesnt tell you anything about your user.
        - No of hits 
        - No of Page views
        - No of visits
        - No of unique visitors
        - No of followers
        - Time on site 
        - Emails collected
        - No of downloads
    - Example of Actionable 
        - % of active users 
        - No of users acquired over a specific period of time
            - Do segmentation analysis concurrently
- Exploratory vs Reporting
    - Unknown insights vs reporting normal day to day ops

    - Circle of Mom case Study
        - Dig into data and look for meaningful patterns and oppurtunities
- Leading vs Lagging
    - Future vs Past 
    - Leading are better as they allow time to act 
    - For leading to work 
        - Cohort analysis
        - Compare group of customers over a period of time 
    - Example of Leading    
        - Current number of prospects in sales funnel 
        - New qualified leads
            - Requires
                - Conversions Rate 
                - Sales length Cycle
    - Example of Lagging 
        - Quartely new bookings
    
    - Churn can be both leading and lagging 
        - Leading
            - Track total number of support calls
            - Customer complaints over a 90 day period 
         
- Correlated vs Causal
    - When two metrics change together vs One metric causes other to change. 
    - Causation occurs due to multiple factors
    - Correlation is good, causality is great

- Moving Targets
    - High Score Case Study
        - Know your customer
        - Create initial benchmarks that can be adjusted later 

- Testing
    - Segmentation
        - Group of people that share a common characterstics
    - Cohort Analysis
        - Compare similar groups over a period of time (Longitudonal)
        - Can be done for
            - Revenue
            - Churn
            - Viral word of mouth
            - Support Cost
    - A/B and multivariate testing
        - Different groups are given different experiment (Cross sectional studies)

### Data Driven vs Data Informed

- Change favors local maxima
- Innovation favors global disruption
- Humans do inspiration, machines validate
- Thinking Like a Data Scientist - Common pitfalls to avoid
    - Assuming data is clean
    - Not normalizing
    - Outliers
    - Ignoring seasonality
    - Ignoring size when reporting growth
    - Focusing on noise

### Big Vision

- Building a to lean what product to build.
